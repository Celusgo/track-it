## About

This is an web application to control your daily habits. It was designed to smaller screens (such as cellphones) but it works fine on bigger screens as well. Below are the implemented features:

- Sign Up
- Login
- Create a new habit
- Choose in which days this habit should be done
- Delete a habit
- Check/uncheck an daily habit
- See your sequence and your record for each habit

<p>
    The motivation for this project was the urge to keep track of my habits without needing to worry about them myself. This way, I could be more productive in other areas of my life.
    In the future, I would like to add a dark theme, multi-language settings and a history page containing your deleted habits.
